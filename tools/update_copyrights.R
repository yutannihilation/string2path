The authorships and the licenses are listed below. In summary, all libraries are
distributed either under the MIT license or under MIT/Apache-2.0 dual license [1].

Note that, when Cargo (Rustâ€™s build system and package manager) is not installed
on the machine, the pre-compiled binary is downloaded on building this package.
The binary is compiled using the same Rust code, so the authorships and the
licenses are the same as listed here.

    Rust code in the library. Please refer to the License section of the README
