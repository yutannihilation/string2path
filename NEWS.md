# string2path 0.1.0

## Breaking changes

* Drop support for R < 4.1.

* Now all functions accept **font family name**. This is to support TTC file
  properly, which contains more than one fonts. A new function `dump_fontdb()`
  is useful to check the actual family name (and the weight and the style) to
  specify.
  They also accept a file path, so the existing code should work, except when
  specifying `tolerance` without the named argument.
